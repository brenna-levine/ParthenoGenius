SUMMARY: SCAN OF MATERNAL HETEROZYGOUS LOCI FOR HOMOZYGOUS GENOTYPES OF MALE OFFSPRING

Total number of loci analyzed: 78603
Number of loci for which mom is heterozygous: 2023
Number of mom's heterozygous loci at which male is homozygous for a maternal allele: 1947
Proportion of mom's heterozygous loci for which male is homozygous for maternal allele: 0.96243
Proportion of mom's heterozygous loci for which male is NOT homozygous for maternal allele (i.e., heterozygous): 0.03757

This parthenogen was likely produced via:	TERMINAL FUSION

	The proportion of mom's heterozygous loci for which male is heterozygous exceeds the error rate.
	Therefore, observed offspring heterozygosity at these loci is likely real and not an artifact of sequencing/genotyping error.
