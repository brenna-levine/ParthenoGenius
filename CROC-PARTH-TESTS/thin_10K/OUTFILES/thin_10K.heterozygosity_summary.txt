SUMMARY: SCAN OF MATERNAL HETEROZYGOUS LOCI FOR OFFSPRING RETAINED HETEROZYGOSITY

Total number of loci analyzed: 191255
Number of loci for which mom is heterozygous: 5015
Number of mom's heterozygous loci for which offspring has retained heterozygosity for a maternal allele: 152
Proportion of mom's heterozygous loci for which offspring has retained heterozygosity for a maternal allele: 0.03031

This parthenogen was likely produced via:	TERMINAL FUSION AUTOMIXIS

	The proportion of mom's heterozygous loci for which offspring has retained heterozygosity is greater than the estimated error rate from the homozygosity scan.
	Therefore, offspring heterozygosity at these loci is not likely an artifact of sequencing error.
