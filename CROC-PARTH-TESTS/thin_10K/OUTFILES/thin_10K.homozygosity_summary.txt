SUMMARY OF RESULTS: SCAN OF MATERNAL HOMOZYGOUS LOCI FOR HETEROZYGOUS MALE OFFSPRING GENOTYPES

Total number of loci analyzed: 191255
Number of loci for which mom is homozygous: 186240
Number of mom's homozygous loci for which at least one of male's alleles differ from maternal alleles: 83
Proportion of mom's homozygous loci for which at least one of male's alleles differ from maternal alleles: 0.00045
Proportion of mom's homozygous loci for which male has identical homozygous genotype to maternal genotype: 0.99955


THE OFFSPRING IS LIKELY A PARTHENOGEN.

	The proportion of mom's homozygous loci at which at least one of male's alleles differs from maternal alleles is less than the error rate.
	Incongruence between maternal genotypes and offspring genotypes at these loci is likely due to sequencing/genotyping error rather than the presence of paternal alleles.
