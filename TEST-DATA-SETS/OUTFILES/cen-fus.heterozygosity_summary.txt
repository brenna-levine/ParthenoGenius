SUMMARY: SCAN OF MATERNAL HETEROZYGOUS LOCI FOR HOMOZYGOUS GENOTYPES OF MALE OFFSPRING

Total number of loci analyzed: 200
Number of loci for which mom is heterozygous: 60
Number of mom's heterozygous loci at which male is homozygous for a maternal allele: 1
Proportion of mom's heterozygous loci for which male is homozygous for maternal allele: 0.017
Proportion of mom's heterozygous loci for which male is NOT homozygous for maternal allele (i.e., heterozygous): 0.983

This parthenogen was likely produced via:	CENTRAL FUSION

	The mom and offspring have a similar number of heterozygous loci.
