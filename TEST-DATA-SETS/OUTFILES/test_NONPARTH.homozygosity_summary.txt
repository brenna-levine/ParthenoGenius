SUMMARY OF RESULTS: SCAN OF MATERNAL HOMOZYGOUS LOCI FOR DISCORDANT OFFSPRING GENOTYPES

Total number of loci analyzed: 200
Number of loci for which mom is homozygous: 140
Number of mom's homozygous loci for which at least one of offspring's alleles differs from maternal alleles: 10
Proportion of mom's homozygous loci for which at least one of offspring's alleles differs from maternal alleles: 0.07143
Proportion of mom's homozygous loci for which offspring has identical homozygous genotypes to maternal homozygous genotypes: 0.92857


THE OFFSPRING IS UNLIKELY TO BE A PARTHENOGEN.

	The proportion of mom's homozygous loci for which at least one of offspring's alleles differs from maternal alleles exceeds the error rate.
	Incongruence between maternal homozygous genotypes and offspring genotypes at these loci are likely due to presence of paternal alleles.


Note: Maternal heterozygosity analysis will not be conducted to test for mode of parthenogenesis.
Note: Heterozygosity outfiles will not be created.
