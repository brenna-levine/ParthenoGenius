SUMMARY: SCAN OF MATERNAL HETEROZYGOUS LOCI FOR HOMOZYGOUS GENOTYPES OF MALE OFFSPRING

Total number of loci analyzed: 200
Number of loci for which mom is heterozygous: 60
Number of mom's heterozygous loci at which male is homozygous for a maternal allele: 60
Proportion of mom's heterozygous loci for which male is homozygous for maternal allele: 1.0
Proportion of mom's heterozygous loci for which male is NOT homozygous for maternal allele (i.e., heterozygous): 0.0

This parthenogen was likely produced via:	GAMETIC DUPLICATION

	The proportion of mom's heterozygous loci for which male is heterozygous is less than the error rate.
	Therefore, male heterozygosity at these loci is likely due to sequencing/genotyping error.
