SUMMARY: SCAN OF MATERNAL HETEROZYGOUS LOCI FOR OFFSPRING RETAINED HETEROZYGOSITY

Total number of loci analyzed: 200
Number of loci for which mom is heterozygous: 60
Number of mom's heterozygous loci for which offspring has retained heterozygosity: 59
Proportion of mom's heterozygous loci for which offspring has retained heterozygosity: 0.98333

This parthenogen was likely produced via:	CENTRAL FUSION AUTOMIXIS

	The mom and offspring have a similar number of heterozygous loci (i.e., limited reduction in offspring heterozygosity).
