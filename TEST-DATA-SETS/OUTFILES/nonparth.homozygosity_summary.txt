SUMMARY OF RESULTS: SCAN OF MATERNAL HOMOZYGOUS LOCI FOR HETEROZYGOUS MALE OFFSPRING GENOTYPES

Total number of loci analyzed: 200
Number of loci for which mom is homozygous: 140
Number of mom's homozygous loci for which at least one of male's alleles differ from maternal alleles: 10
Proportion of mom's homozygous loci for which at least one of male's alleles differ from maternal alleles: 0.071
Proportion of mom's homozygous loci for which male has identical homozygous genotype to maternal genotype: 0.929


THE OFFSPRING IS UNLIKELY TO BE A PARTHENOGEN.

	The proportion of mom's homozygous loci for which at least one of male's alleles differs from maternal alleles exceeds the error rate.
	Incongruence between maternal homozogyous genotypes and offspring genotypes at these loci are likely due to presence of paternal alleles.


Note: Maternal heterozygosity analysis will not be conducted to test for mode of parthenogenesis.
Note: Heterozygosity outfiles will not be created.
